# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

OpenShorts is an AI-powered vertical video generator that transforms long YouTube videos or local uploads into viral-ready short clips (9:16 format) for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. Uses Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for viral moment detection and title generation.

## Development Commands

### Local Development (Docker)
```bash
docker compose up --build   # Build and run full stack
```
- Backend: http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI/Uvicorn)
- Frontend: http://localhost:5175 (Vite proxies API calls to backend)

### Frontend Only (Dashboard)
```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev       # Dev server with HMR (port 5173)
npm run build     # Production build
npm run lint      # ESLint (strict, --max-warnings 0)
```

### Backend Only
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Architecture

### Core Processing Pipeline
1. **Ingest** - YouTube download (yt-dlp) or local upload
2. **Transcription** - faster-whisper with word-level timestamps
3. **Scene Detection** - PySceneDetect for segment boundaries
4. **AI Analysis** - Gemini identifies 3-15 viral moments (15-60 sec each)
5. **FFmpeg Extraction** - Precise clip cutting
6. **AI Cropping** - Vertical reframing with subject tracking
7. **Effects/Subtitles** - Optional AI-generated FFmpeg filters
8. **Hook Overlay** - Text overlays with styled fonts
9. **Voice Dubbing** - Optional ElevenLabs AI translation (30+ languages)
10. **S3 Backup** - Silent background upload
11. **Social Distribution** - Upload-Post API (async upload)

### Key Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.py` | Core video processing: transcription, scene detection, clip extraction, vertical reframing |
| `app.py` | FastAPI server with async job queue and REST endpoints |
| `editor.py` | Gemini AI integration for dynamic video effects (FFmpeg filter generation) |
| `hooks.py` | Hook text overlay generation with font rendering |
| `s3_uploader.py` | AWS S3 upload with caching |
| `subtitles.py` | SRT generation, FFmpeg subtitle burning, and dubbed video transcription |
| `translate.py` | ElevenLabs dubbing API for AI voice translation |
| `dashboard/src/App.jsx` | Main React component with state management |
| `dashboard/src/components/TranslateModal.jsx` | Voice dubbing UI with language selection |

### Dual-Mode Video Reframing
- **TRACK Mode** (single subject): MediaPipe face detection + YOLOv8 fallback with "Heavy Tripod" stabilization
- **GENERAL Mode** (groups/landscapes): Blurred background layout preserving full width

### Key Classes
- `SmoothedCameraman` - Stabilized camera movement with safe zone logic (prevents jitter)
- `SpeakerTracker` - Prevents rapid speaker switching, handles temporary occlusions

### API Endpoints
| Method | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| POST | `/api/process` | Submit video for processing |
| GET | `/api/status/{job_id}` | Poll job status and logs |
| POST | `/api/edit` | Apply AI video effects |
| POST | `/api/subtitle` | Generate and apply subtitles (auto-transcribes dubbed videos) |
| POST | `/api/hook` | Add text hook overlays |
| POST | `/api/translate` | AI voice dubbing via ElevenLabs |
| GET | `/api/translate/languages` | List supported dubbing languages |
| POST | `/api/social/post` | Post to social media (async upload) |

### Concurrency Model
Async job queue with semaphore-based concurrency control. Configure via `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` env var (default: 5). Jobs auto-cleanup after 1 hour.

## Environment Variables

**Server-side (.env):**
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_S3_BUCKET` - For S3 backup
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` - Concurrent processing limit (default: 5)
- `VITE_API_URL` - Production API URL override

**Client-side (localStorage, encrypted):**
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini API key (required)
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - ElevenLabs API key for voice dubbing (optional)
- `UPLOAD_POST_API_KEY` - Upload-Post API key for social posting (optional)

> API keys are stored encrypted in the browser and sent via headers only when needed. Never stored server-side.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.11, FastAPI, google-genai, faster-whisper, ultralytics (YOLOv8), mediapipe, opencv-python, yt-dlp, FFmpeg, httpx
- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite 4, Tailwind CSS 3.4
- **External APIs:** Google Gemini, ElevenLabs Dubbing, Upload-Post
- **Infrastructure:** Docker + Docker Compose, AWS S3

## Automated Issue and Pull Request Flow

Follow this repository workflow when reviewing or fixing changes:

1. Reproduce the GitHub issue and record the clean baseline.
2. Implement the smallest complete fix and add a regression test.
3. Require backend tests, frontend lint/build, and Docker builds to pass in CI.
4. After green CI, run three independent reviewers in parallel:
   - correctness, regressions, edge cases, and tests;
   - security, concurrency, resource handling, and secrets;
   - repository-rule compliance and maintainability risks.
5. Validate and deduplicate all findings before changing code.
6. Allow at most two automated review/fix rounds. Every code change must return through CI.
7. After Claude reports no confirmed findings, run Codex Code Review and Security Review.
8. Never merge automatically. The protected `main` branch and final CI decide whether the PR is mergeable.

## Code Review Rules

- Report only concrete bugs or security problems introduced by the pull request.
- Require a specific file and line reference plus a reproducible failure path for every finding.
- Ignore formatting that ESLint already enforces and avoid subjective style comments.
- Distinguish new regressions from pre-existing problems.
- Check input validation, path and command injection, authentication, authorization, secret exposure, unsafe file handling, race conditions, cleanup, and unbounded resource use.
- Treat media uploads, URLs, filenames, subprocess arguments, FFmpeg filters, and external API responses as untrusted input.
- Require regression tests for fixes whenever a deterministic test is practical.
- Focus Codex review comments on P0 and P1 findings.
